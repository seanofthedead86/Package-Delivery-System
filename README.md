This python program, written in Pycharm, solves a variation of the taveling salesman problem.

Three trucks total deliver the packagaes, and as each truck delivers a package, the status of the package changes from 'On Truck' to 'Delivered' as well as the time the packagae has been delievred. The goal of the program was to have all packages delievered by the of end of the business day, as well has have all the priority packages delievered by the specified time. All packages were delievered at 1311. Screenshots of the outputs at three different times are in the folder.
